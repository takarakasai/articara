//! The walker: the G1 / kyo46rs biped's whole control loop behind one
//! object (S13 of doc/from_claude/20261029_walker_extraction_plan.md).
//!
//! [`WalkerInit::new`] makes the plan from the settled pose (the footsteps,
//! the schedule, the speed schedule, the staircase's footfalls, COM_PREPLAN,
//! the DCM plan and the landing clock) and initialises the controller's
//! state; [`WalkerInit::with_stack`] attaches the WBC stack (built by the
//! harness from [`WalkerInit::contact_params`]) and gives the [`Walker`].
//! Each tick the harness calls [`Walker::step`] with the [`Observation`]
//! (the state estimate, from which the walker assembles the dynamics and
//! kinematics itself; phases 1-12: the landing clock, the support and contacts, the DCM
//! reference and its push responses, the commanded ZMP, the CoM preview, the
//! height, the wrench MPC, the levels' references, the stack's solve and the
//! solve's diagnostics) and, after its own scenario (the push) has fired,
//! [`Walker::end_tick`] (phase 13). Lines go to a [`LogSink`] as they are
//! decided and opt-in records to a [`WalkerDiag`]; the walker reads no
//! environment variable and opens no file.
//!
//! The phase functions themselves are in `phases.rs`, moved verbatim from
//! the example's control loop (S11); the runs are byte-identical to it.
