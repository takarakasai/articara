//! The seam between the walker and its whole-body QP: what the walker asks
//! for each tick ([`WbcRequest`]), what it gets back ([`WbcSolution`]), and
//! the trait a stack of QP levels implements ([`WbcStack`]).
//!
//! Added on 2026-10-30 (S12 of doc/from_claude/20261029_walker_extraction_plan.md,
//! §2.6, plan A: one coarse trait). The walker computes the REFERENCES --
//! numbers: the CoM acceleration, the trunk's orientation target, the
//! momentum and arm-hold targets, the swing foot's target and gains, the
//! load split, the MPC's wrenches -- and the CONTACT REQUEST (which feet,
//! their load shares, rigid or managed, a moved CoP box, the anchor
//! events). Building the levels, ordering and weighting them, solving and
//! extracting the result are the stack's. The stack keeps its own state
//! across ticks: the solver's warm start, the last QP structure and the
//! contact anchors.
//!
//! articara's `TaskStack` (`articara::biped::wbc_stack`) implements it with
//! the level builders of `biped::tasks` / `biped::contact` and
//! `misa_wbc::Solver`; another runner (another QP, a real robot) can put its
//! own stack behind the same request.
