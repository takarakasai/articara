//! One builder per priority level of the biped's hierarchical QP.
//!
//! The level ORDER is the driver's business, not this module's -- it changes
//! between double and single support and between experiments, and hiding it
//! behind a fixed list is how a "level 4" tally came to mislabel every
//! single-support run by one. What lives here is how each level's matrices
//! and reference are built, so that two drivers (squat and walk) cannot drift
//! apart in the details.
//!
//! Moved from articara's `biped::tasks` on 2026-10-30 (S13d of
//! doc/from_claude/20261029_walker_extraction_plan.md), which re-exports it
//! under its old path. [`crate::task_stack::TaskStack`] is the walker's
//! driver of these builders.
