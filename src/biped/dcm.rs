//! Balance reference from the divergent component of motion.
//!
//! Under the linear inverted pendulum model the CoM splits into a stable and
//! an unstable part. The unstable one,
//!
//! ```text
//! xi = c + c_dot / omega        omega = sqrt(g / z_com)
//! ```
//!
//! obeys `xi_dot = omega (xi - p)` where `p` is the ZMP: first order, and
//! directly steerable by where the pressure is put. The CoM then follows
//! `c_dot = -omega (c - xi)`, which is stable on its own. So planning the
//! ZMP and tracking the DCM is the whole balance problem, and it needs no QP
//! of its own -- the output is a commanded CoM acceleration, which is exactly
//! what the P1 task already consumes.
//!
//! # Why this replaces the latched lateral target
//!
//! Single-leg stance used a ramp to a lateral CoM target that was frozen on
//! the first tick (`LATCH_STANCE`). Freezing was correct as far as it went --
//! reading the stance foot's position every tick put the plant inside its own
//! reference and cost a fall with ZERO degraded solves. But a frozen target
//! cannot walk. The fix is not to unfreeze it; it is to generate it from the
//! FOOTSTEP PLAN, which is world-frame data that no measurement feeds back
//! into. If the foot moves, that is a disturbance to reject, not a new goal.

/// Step-timing adjustment: how long the current single support should still
/// last so that the DCM arrives where the plan wanted it.
///
/// # Why timing and not placement
///
/// During single support the ZMP is parked at the stance sole, so the DCM
/// obeys `xi(t) = p + (xi_0 - p) exp(omega t)` in closed form. Two knobs can
/// steer where it ends up at touchdown: WHERE the next foot goes, and WHEN it
/// gets there. Placement is [`crate::biped::gait::FootstepPlan`]'s adaptation
/// (`ADAPT_STEP`), and on this machine it is measured harmful -- 26 grid
/// points improved against 83 worsened over 672 runs (doc Sec.19.6). Timing
/// has never been tried: `t_ss` is a constant, so a disturbed machine walks
/// the same schedule as an undisturbed one and commits to the next stance
/// foot at a time chosen before the push happened.
///
/// # The solve
///
/// Fix the footstep, target the plan's own end-of-segment DCM `xi_eos`, and
/// invert the closed form for the remaining time:
///
/// ```text
/// xi_eos = p + (xi_meas - p) exp(omega tau)
/// tau    = ln((xi_eos - p) / (xi_meas - p)) / omega
/// ```
///
/// This is a division and a log, not an optimisation -- there is no QP and no
/// MPC here. The catch is that it is one equation per axis and only one
/// unknown, so the two axes disagree; `axis` picks which one to honour.
/// Lateral (`1`) is the default because that is the axis this machine falls
/// on: the lateral CoP box is +-19 mm against +-49 mm fore-aft, and every
/// failure traced in Sec.19 was the stance CoP pinned to the lateral edge.
///
/// The outcome of [`step_timing`], which is not always a time.
///
/// The distinction matters and measuring it changed the reading of the whole
/// feature: on a run that falls, the solve reports [`Unreachable`] on 75 of 83
/// ticks and returns a time on only 8, while runs that survive ask for a time
/// once or not at all. So the timing adaptation, as first written, was silent
/// on exactly the disturbance class that kills the machine -- its measured
/// gain came from correcting steps that were merely late.
