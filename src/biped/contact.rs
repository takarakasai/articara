//! Contact anchors, contact Jacobians, and the foot-link -> sole wrench map.
//!
//! Three things live here that each cost a day to find:
//!
//! 1. **The contact constraint needs Baumgarte.** `zero_contact_acceleration`
//!    pins `J*qddot + Jdot*v = 0`, an ACCELERATION constraint: give the foot
//!    any angular velocity and its orientation drifts at that rate forever,
//!    because nothing feeds the pose error back. Invisible in a symmetric
//!    squat (the foot never acquires roll rate) and fatal in a lateral weight
//!    shift, where the stance sole rolled to 19 deg while the solver still
//!    reported the contact satisfied. Once the sole is on its edge, the
//!    rectangular CoP box describes a footprint that is no longer touching
//!    the floor.
//! 2. **A frozen anchor becomes a phantom force.** See [`Anchors::leak`].
//! 3. **The CoP box is about the SOLE, not the foot link origin.** See
//!    [`sole_selection`].
